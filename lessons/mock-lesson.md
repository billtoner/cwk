# CWK Lesson - Speed

## Introduction (1 min)

- Okay class.  Good afternoon.  Is everyone here for the Coding with Kids class? 

- My name is Mr. Toner and you can call me Mr. Toner.  
- It's nice to meet you all and I'm excited for us to dig into some coding exercises.  Please be patient with me as I learn all of your names. 

- As we go through the material today please raise your hand if you have a question and I'll get to you as soon as I can. I may ask you to please hold your question for a minute until we get to a better stopping point. 

- Also please remember the behavioral guidelines for the class so that we can move along quickly.  I know you're excited to get to the good stuff and so am I.  We are going to move as fast as we can as a group but please do not be afraid to ask questions.  I like questions.  I really like it when students are curious. 

- Let's get started. 

## Concept Introduction/Motivation (2-3 min)

- Okay today we're going to be working on the speed project.  Let's see some program examples of speed in action

  - Fish Game: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/99918963/

  - Car Game: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/99921831/

## Review Variables (1-2 min)

- Who knows what a variable is?  (A variable is something that stores a value. We can set that value, 
  or change that value, or even use that value somewhere else)

## Review Speed Variables (3-5 min)

- Who knows what speed is?  How would you define it? 
  (Go around the class)

- Speed Example: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/99906892/editor/

- Why does this work?  (Because we changed the code to do more move_steps)

- How can we use variables with speed? 
  - https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/99906892/
  - (Create a variable for speed.  Then instead of changing the code we can change the variable)

- How come using variables is better than hard coded values?  
  - Because what if you had 100 blocks where move_steps was coded in? Now you have to make 10 changes. If you use a variable then you only have to make one change.
