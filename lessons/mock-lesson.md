# CWK Lesson - Speed

## Introduction (1 min)

- Okay class.  Good afternoon.  Is everyone here for the Coding with Kids class? 

- It's nice to meet you all and I'm excited for us to dig into some coding exercises.  My name is Mr. Toner and you can call me Mr. Toner.  I'm going to try to learn all of your names here quickly. 

- As we go through the material today please raise your hand if you have a question and I'll get to you as soon as I can. I may ask you to please hold your question for a minute until we get to a better stopping point. 

- Also please remember the behavioral guidelines for the class so that we can move along quickly.  I know you're excited to get to the good stuff and so am I.  We are going to move as fast as we can as a group but please do not be afraid to ask questions.  I like questions.  I really like it when students are curious. 

- Let's get started. 

## Concept Introduction/Motivation (2-3 min)

### Speed Project

  - Our goal is to learn about changing the speed of an object in a Scratch program 
  - Let's see some program examples of speed in action
    - Fish Game: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/99918963/
    - Car Game: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/99921831/

## Review Variables (1-2 min)

- Who knows what a variable is?  

  - What are some example names of variables?
  - What might be a benefit of using a variable? 
  - What can I name a variable?
    - Anything I want
  - What <em>should</em> I name a variable?
    - Something that sounds logical or makes sense when you read it back to yourself 
    - Why?
      - Think about the next person who has to maintain the program 
      - Think about the next time you come back to the program a year from now.  Are you going to remember what x is? 

## Review Speed Variables (3-5 min)

- Who knows what speed is?  

  - How would you define it? 
  - What types of objects are associated with speed, fast or slow? 

- Speed Example: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/99906892

- Why does this work?  (Because we changed the code to do more move_steps)

- How can we use variables with speed?

- Hard coded speed

  - https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/785672366/editor
    - Is hard coded speed a good practice (Hint: no)

- How come using a speed variable better than using a hard coded value?  

  - Because what if you had 100 blocks where move_steps was coded in? Now you have to make 10 changes. If you use a variable then you only have to make one change. 

- Questions on speed or variables variables?
