# Variables

As we talk about these, we can explore the code categories in Scratch 
to see if there's something that matches up pretty well. 

## Variables Examples

   What is a variable?  What's a variable good for?  
   Why would I want to use a variable instead of just type in 10?   
   What are some names we can use for variables?  
     
### Some good variable names  
     speed  
     direction  
     grocery_list
     player_name
     owner_address
     owner_zip_code
     
### Some not so great variable names
     my_variable
     x
     y
     a
     b
     c
     my_item1
     my_item2
     
### Some illegal names
     1x  
     2y
