# Variables

As we talk about these, we can explore the code categories in Scratch 
to see if there's something that matches up pretty well. 

## Variables Examples

   What is a variable?  What's a variable good for?
   Why would I want to use a variable instead of just type in 10? 
   What are some names we can use for variables?
     
   Some good names
     speed
     direction
     grocery_list
     player_name
     owner_address
     owner_zip_code
     
   Some not great names
     my_variable
     x
     y
     a
     b
     c
     my_item1
