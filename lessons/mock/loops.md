    What's a loop in software programming?
      Something we want to do repeatedly?
      Something we want to do more than once? 
        What if I want to do something zero times?
      Would we ever want to exit a loop?
      Would we ever want to just stay in a loop forever?
      What are some different types of loops?
        Forever
        Repeat Until some condition exists - like I enter "Y" 
        Repeat exactly 10 times
