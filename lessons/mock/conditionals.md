# Conditionals

As we talk about these, we can explore the code categories in Scratch 
to see if there's something that matches up pretty well. 

## What's a conditional?

    I like to go for walks through Portland.  Am I going to go if it's -20 degrees out?
    Only do something if a certain situation exists

    The Mariners have a stadium where the roof can close up. Why?
    Are they going to close it up if it's nice and sunny outside?
    If it's raining, then close the stadium roof 
    Or better yet, If there's a home game today AND If it's raining, then close the stadium roof 
    Or even better, If there's a home gamd today AND it's rained > 1/2" then close the stadium roof 

    I want to go to the Blazer game but not sure if I can afford it, so I check the ticket prices. 
    If tickets are less than $50, then I will buy one 

    Conditionals are for specifying doing something but only when a certain condition exists.  
    Like it's raining outside, or if the price is right, or if the weather is warm enough. 
    Otherwise, I'm not going to do those things.  

    What is the key word to look for in a conditional? IF

    Can you show us where they are and what they are?
