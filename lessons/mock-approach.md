How I expect it to work: 
  5 of us -- We each will probably be asked to pick one topic from
  Motions and Events, Loops, Conditionals, Variables 
  Then we will be asked to cover the 3 areas for this task
    Concept Discussion, Project Planning, Independent Work

  In the Concept Discussion section, keep it real high level.  
  Analogies, examples, etc. to teach what the concept is "like" 
  Involve the students to 

  If I get to pick first ... 

Intro:
  Let's go around the room and please give me your name and your favorite sports team. 

Motion and Events (5 min each section)
  Concept Discussion
    What is motion?
      Movement in steps 
      Movement in mph (car)
      Movement in knots (boat)
    Can motion be negative (go backwards)? 

    What is an event?     
      When I click on the Green Flag
      When I click on the Space bar
      When I click on the escape key 
      T-Mobile Park: When it's raining close the roof 
      When someone pushes and elevator button go up or down
      
  Project Planning (Pseudo Code)

    When someone presses on the green flag (Event)
    Set my inition position on the screen (Motion)
      # First we have to figure out where to start on the screen 
    Set speed to its initial value (Variables)
    Loop (Control)
      point towards mouse pointer (Motion)
      move some number of steps (Motion)
    End Loop

  Independent Work
    Review the left panel of Motion and Event options
    Explore some options for Events, Motion, Control, and Variables

Loops and Direction (5 min each section)
  Concept Discussion
    What's a loop? 
      Race track (Cars, runners)
      A Ferris Wheel
      A Merry Go Round 
    What's a loop in software programming?
      Something we do repeatedly?
      Something we do more than once? 
        What if I want to do something zero times?
      Would we ever want to exit a loop?
      Would we ever want to just stay in a loop forever?
      What are some different types of loops?
        Forever
        Repeat Until some condition exists - like I enter "Y" 
        Repeat exactly 10 times
      
      Who can find the different Loop types in Scratch?
        Can you show us what they are and where they are?
