## Introduction

- Okay class.  Good afternoon.  Is everyone here for the Coding with Kids class? 

- It's nice to meet you all and I'm excited for us to dig into some coding exercises.  My name is Mr. Toner and you can call me Mr. Toner.

- Let's go around the room and please introduce yourself and if you would, please mention your favorite sports team. 

- As we go through the material today please raise your hand if you have a question and I'll get to you as soon as I can.

- Also please remember the behavioral guidelines for the class so that we can move along quickly.  I know you're excited to get to the good stuff and so am I.  We are going to move as fast as we can as a group but please do not be afraid to ask questions.  I like questions.  I really like it when students are curious. 

- Any questions?  Okay, let's get started.
